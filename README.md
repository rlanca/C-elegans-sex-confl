Data and R scripts for honors research thesis, "Mating Affects Lifespan Differently in Two Strains of Pseudo-female Caenorhabditis elegans."

The master branch is recovered from a local save file used for my undergraduate research. No edits have been made to preserve the integrity of the project. 
However, both data and R scripts have been saved in a manner that makes it confusing to understand, and not up to par for standards in reproducible data science.

Updated code and scripts will be saved in a branch titled "clarity_updates."
The goal is to combine disparate R scripts with different functions into one cohesive script that performs the statistical analyses and data vis. all in one place.

The paper associated with this data is available at https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/handle/1794/25555.

Current progress: 

1. Create script to generate all figures in paper [Complete] âœ“
2. Create script to generate figures in paper AND data analyses in one place [In progress] ...
