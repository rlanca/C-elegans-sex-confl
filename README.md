Data and R scripts for honors research thesis, "Mating Affects Lifespan Differently in Two Strains of Pseudo-female Caenorhabditis elegans."

This master branch is recovered from a local save file used for my undergraduate research. No edits have been made to preserve the integrity of the project. 
However, both data and R scripts have been saved in a manner that makes it confusing to understand, and not up to par for standards in reproducible data science.

Updated code and scripts will be saved in a branch titled "clarity_updates."
The goal is to combine disparate R scripts with different functions into one cohesive script that performs the statistical analyses and data vis. all in one place, pulling from one data file.

The paper associated with this data is available at https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/handle/1794/25555.
